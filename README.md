### <a name="details"> 1. Project Details</a>
The main objective of this project is to create a platform for online electronic shopping. It is a multi seller e-commerce website which is capable of maintaining the storage of a large number of products by different sellers. The website is capable enough to store the products and also perform some updating on the products that are stored. It has a user friendly interface that will guide users to easily buy electronics for a reasonable price directly from the seller. This System allows to view the items stored in the cart and the order details.There are two roles **admin** and **user**.The **admin** can add, edit, view and delete thier own products. The **user** can add to cart, order and view products on this website.


This system stores all the information in a MYSQL Database. It stores data of the users/admins logged in, details of the admin, the products, cart details, order details, payment details. The user has to register to the website to order products to avoid spam user logins. Laravel includes built-in authentication and session services which are typically accessed via the Auth and Session facades. The frontend user interface of the website is developed using **HTML5, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap**.
